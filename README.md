# ArduAir

This project is an air quality sensor that measures humidity, temperature, smoke levels, and particle matter. It uses an ESP8266 WiFi module and the Blynk app for data visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **Blynk:** Used for data visualization.
- **ESP8266WiFi:** WiFi library for ESP8266.
- **DHT:** Library for reading from DHT humidity and temperature sensors.
- **Arduino:** General-purpose library for Arduino functions and macros.

## Hardware Components Used

- NodeMCU ESP8266 Microcontroller
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- MQ-135 Gas Sensor
- PMS5003 Particulate Matter Sensor
- 5V Power Supply
- Digilent Solderless Breadboard
  
## Features

- Measures and displays humidity, temperature, and smoke levels.
- Checks and transmits PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 values of the air.
- Sends sensor data to the Blynk app.
